# developer.wordpress.org

This is the work-in-progress for the forthcoming developer.wordpress.org aka devhub

There are a number of ways to get involved:

* get set up with the [devhub development environment](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/wiki/DevHub) to help with development
* help out with the [inline docs efforts](http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/inline-docs) 
* help out with the [plugin](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/) and [theme](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/) developer handbooks

The regular devhub meeting is on Tuesdays at 15:00 UTC in irc.freenode.net #wordpress-sfd.

Discussion occurs on [make.wordpress.org/docs](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/devhub/)

Issues are on trac on the [developer.wordpress.org component](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=!closed&component=developer.wordpress.org).
